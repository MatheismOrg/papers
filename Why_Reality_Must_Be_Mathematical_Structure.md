# **Why Reality Must Be Mathematical Structure**

*Gary Bernstein • matheism.org*

**Abstract**

All that must exist is infinite consistent math; nothing else can coherently exist. Any intelligible reality must exhibit either patterns or apparent randomness, both inherently mathematical structures. This exhaustive dichotomy establishes mathematical structure as necessary for existence itself, not merely for our descriptions of it. Even if 'structureless existence' were coherent, it would be fundamentally unknowable. A transcendental corollary follows: observers are logically constrained to patterned realities by necessity, not probabilistic selection. From this foundation, all interacting dualisms collapse into structural monism; consciousness, insofar as it causally interacts, must itself be structure. Independent considerations (identical mathematical structures appearing across unrelated physical domains), the 'unreasonable effectiveness' of mathematics, corroborate the conclusion. Unlike standard Ontic Structural Realism, which describes what exists, this argument establishes *why* structure must exist: mathematical consistency is logically necessary, and nothing else is coherent.

## **1\. Introduction**

Physical reality is not described by mathematics; it is identical to mathematical structure. This paper establishes that conclusion through a priori argument, not empirical inference. The route begins with an observation about contemporary physics: the dominant ontology, physicalism, has progressively dematerialized the 'physical.' From fields to quantum wavefunctions, the concrete 'stuff' of the world has evaporated, leaving only mathematical structure. Yet physicalism continues to posit that mathematics *describes* some underlying substance, rather than accepting the simpler conclusion: the structure *is* the substance.

This paper takes physicalism's methodology to its logical conclusion, providing a rigorous foundation for mathematical structural realism. This position represents the ultimate form of Ontic Structural Realism (OSR), defended by Ladyman and Ross (2007) and developed by French (2014, 2022), though grounded here through novel *a priori* argument rather than empirical inference. Critics of OSR, notably Psillos (2001) and Chakravartty (2007), have questioned whether the position can be distinguished from standard scientific realism or whether it collapses into Platonism. The present argument addresses these challenges: the pattern-randomness dichotomy establishes structure as primitive rather than abstracted from prior objects, and the transcendental constraint shows why observation necessitates structure. Crucially, standard OSR describes structure as the sole constituent of reality but does not explain *why* structure exists. The present argument completes OSR by showing that existence is logically necessary: self-consistent mathematical structure cannot fail to exist, just as the number one cannot fail to exist.

The present argument differs fundamentally from Tegmark's (2014) Mathematical Universe Hypothesis (MUH). Tegmark posits that all mathematical structures exist as a cosmological conjecture, a hypothesis about the world that could, in principle, be false. The position defended here attempts to *derive* this conclusion from a priori considerations: if the pattern-randomness dichotomy is sound, nothing non-mathematical can coherently exist, making the existence of all consistent structures not a hypothesis but a consequence of the analysis. The difference is between asserting 'reality happens to be mathematical' and arguing 'reality must be mathematical.' Whether the argument succeeds is for the reader to judge; but the dialectical structure differs from Tegmark's.

The argument proceeds from an exhaustive dichotomy: anything intelligible exhibits either discoverable patterns or apparent randomness. Both are inherently mathematical, patterns by definition, and randomness through probability theory and algorithmic complexity. This establishes mathematical structure as necessary for intelligibility. Section 2 argues that nothing coherent can exist outside mathematical structure. A crucial corollary, and a distinctive contribution, establishes that observers are logically constrained to patterned realities. This is a transcendental constraint, not probabilistic selection: the question 'why do we observe patterns?' is necessarily self-answering, since observation itself presupposes pattern. Section 3 demonstrates that any interacting dualism collapses into structural monism, and addresses standard objections from the philosophy of mind. Section 4 responds to objections and clarifies scope. The conclusion notes independent corroborating considerations that, while not part of the a priori argument, provide consilience, and briefly flags further implications for cosmology, ethics, and the unification of parsimony principles across domains.

A clarification on terminology: by 'mathematical structure' I mean purely relational organization, entities defined entirely by their relations to other entities within the structure. This is the structuralist sense of Ladyman/Ross and French, not Platonism about abstract objects. Numbers and sets are paradigm cases, but the claim is type-neutral: any relational organization whatsoever counts as mathematical structure in the relevant sense, compatible with naturalistic metaphysics.

For convenience, I will call this position *mathematical structural necessitarianism*, or *matheism* for short: the thesis that mathematical structure is the sole, necessary, uncreated ground of all existence.\[^1\] The term is apt because mathematical structure, if the argument succeeds, occupies the explanatory role that classical theology assigned to God: eternal, self-necessitating, requiring no external creator or substrate. This is Spinoza's move updated: not *Deus sive Natura* but *Deus sive Mathematica*. A companion paper develops the cosmological implications, including the measure problem and fine-tuning.

\[^1\]: The term 'matheism' is merely a convenient label for mathematical structural necessitarianism. Readers who find it distracting may substitute the longer phrase throughout.

## **2\. The Core Argument: The Pattern-Randomness Dichotomy**

### **2.1 The Necessity of Relational Structure**

For anything to exist and be distinguishable from nothing, it must possess determinate features; specific rather than arbitrary characteristics. 'Something' differs from 'nothing' by having properties: spatial extension, temporal duration, charge, mass, complexity. These cannot be entirely arbitrary or undefined, or the 'something' would be indistinguishable from nothing. This is not a claim about epistemology (about what we can *know*, but about ontology: what it *is* for something to exist. Existence requires determinacy; determinacy requires distinguishing features; distinguishing features require relations of sameness and difference.

But properties do not float free; they form a relational structure. Each property is defined by its connections to others. Mass relates to energy through E=mc². Position relates to velocity through derivative relationships. Electric charge relates to electromagnetic fields through Maxwell's equations. A property's identity is constituted by how it relates to other properties within the overall structure.

Physics has progressively revealed that fundamental reality contains no non-relational 'stuff.' What seemed like solid particles became excitations in fields. Fields became representations of symmetry groups. Forces became geometric curvatures in spacetime. At each level, the concrete substance dissolved into relational structure. The electron is not a tiny ball with properties attached, it is a pattern of relationships: how it couples to the electromagnetic field, how it responds to measurements, how it relates to other fermions through the Pauli exclusion principle. As Esfeld and Lam (2008) argue, fundamental physics increasingly supports 'moderate structural realism', though the present argument suggests the moderation is unnecessary.

### **2.2 The Identity Argument: From Isomorphism to Identity**

Any relational structure is isomorphic to at least one mathematical object. An isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping: it preserves all relations while potentially changing labels. If structure A is isomorphic to structure B, every relationship in A has a corresponding relationship in B, and vice versa.

Now consider: what distinguishes a physical relational structure from an isomorphic mathematical structure? Not their relationships: these are identical by definition of isomorphism. Every connection in one corresponds to a connection in the other. Not their causal powers, causal powers supervene on relational structure. If A causes B, this relationship is part of the structure. Isomorphic structures have identical causal patterns. Not their observable properties; all observable properties reduce to relational structure. Color is wavelength (relationship to electromagnetic spectrum). Hardness is bonding strength (relationship between atoms). Temperature is molecular motion (relationship between kinetic energy and degrees of freedom). Not any structural feature, by definition, isomorphism preserves all structural features.

The only remaining candidate is non-relational 'substrate', some primitive 'physical stuff' that bears properties without being constituted by them. This is what philosophers call 'bare particulars' or 'substrata': something that has properties but is not defined by them.

But this substrate faces significant problems. First, physics has eliminated it. Quantum field theory contains no objects with intrinsic properties independent of their role in relational structure. The electron's mass (0.511 MeV/c²), charge (-e), and spin (½ℏ) are not properties attached to some underlying electron-stuff. They *are* how electrons relate to fields, other particles, and measurement operations. Remove these relations, and nothing remains. The Standard Model is purely relational, gauge fields, coupling constants, and symmetry groups, with no underlying substance. Whether our quanta are literally just numbers, mathematical values with no other properties; it is a physics question about which structure we inhabit. Some universes' quanta must be.

Second, substrate does no explanatory work. Consider two systems with identical relational structure but hypothetically different substrates. They behave identically in all observable ways. The substrate makes no difference to anything we can measure, predict, or explain. It is explanatorily idle: a violation of Occam's Razor. More fundamentally, any proposed substrate must itself have determinate features (else it is nothing), and determinate features constitute structure. By the pattern-randomness dichotomy, substrate *is* structure, the very thing it was meant to underlie.

Consider chess implemented in carved wood, in computer memory, or as pure mathematical abstraction. No chess property, no legal move, no winning strategy, no checkmate, differs across implementations. The game is the relational structure; the wood is merely one access-mode. One might object: the wood and the silicon clearly differ; you can burn one but not the other. But this confuses the *game* with its *physical embedding*. Burning the wood destroys a token, not the type. The game's structure remains untouched, just as the number 7 survives the destruction of any particular numeral. If no *chess property* differs, what remains to distinguish 'physical chess' from 'mathematical chess'? Nothing. The distinction marks a difference in our access, not in the object accessed.

Third, the Identity of Indiscernibles. If two things share all their properties, including all relational properties, what non-question-begging criterion distinguishes them? Leibniz's principle states: if A and B have all the same properties, then A *is* B. This principle has been contested (Black, 1952; Adams, 1979), but observe that the principle is itself a structural claim: entities are individuated by their relational properties. Critics who reject it must specify what *could* distinguish two entities sharing all relational properties. Any proposed distinguisher is itself a property; if the entities differ in that property, they do not share all properties after all. The argument may therefore be framed conditionally: if the Identity of Indiscernibles holds, if entities are individuated relationally: then isomorphic structures are numerically identical. Haecceities are substrate by another name. They are invoked precisely to distinguish entities when all relational properties match, but this is the work we have already shown no non-relational posit can perform. The haecceitist must specify what makes *this* haecceity differ from *that* one. Any answer appeals to distinguishing features, which are properties. No answer leaves the distinction primitive and unexplanatory, which is to say, no answer at all. Haecceity does not solve the individuation problem; it names the place where a solution should go.

Max Black's symmetric universe, two qualitatively identical spheres in otherwise empty space: appears to refute the Identity of Indiscernibles. But the spheres differ relationally: each is 'the one two miles from the other.' Their distinctness is constituted by their mutual spatial relations within the complete structure. As Saunders (2006) argues, even putatively identical fermions are weakly discernible through irreflexive relations. Moreover, haecceity requires something non-relational to bear the 'thisness.' But if reality is purely relational, as argued above and as physics suggests: there exists nothing for haecceity to be a property of. The haecceitist must reject structural realism entirely, not merely add primitive individuators to it.

A standard objection to structural realism, Newman's (1928) critique of Russell, holds that any set of objects can be organized into any structure, making structural claims trivially true. The present argument avoids this because the dichotomy is not a claim about how we *organize* reality but about what reality *could coherently be*. Newman's objection targets epistemic structural realism (the claim that we can only know structure); it does not touch the present ontic claim that structure exhausts what exists. The question is not 'can we impose structure on any substrate?' but 'can anything coherent lack structure?' The answer is no, and this is not trivialized by Newman's point.

**Therefore:** By Leibniz's Identity of Indiscernibles, physical reality and mathematical structure are not merely similar: they are identical. Reality *is* mathematical structure, not an instantiation of it in some separate substrate.

### **2.3 Two Types of Structure and the Exhaustiveness of the Dichotomy**

Having argued that reality is mathematical structure, we now examine the landscape of possible structures. This landscape contains two fundamental types.

*Patterns* are structures with low generative complexity, governed by rules simpler than the structure itself. This includes the laws of physics (compact equations generating vast complexity), simple algorithms like Conway's Game of Life (4 rules generating infinite patterns), the digits of π (infinite non-repeating sequence generated by finite formula), fractal structures (infinite detail from recursive rules), and deterministic chaos (complex behavior from simple dynamics). The key feature: there exists a finite description that generates or explains the structure.

*Apparent randomness* includes phenomena that seem patternless but arise from compact mathematical descriptions. The digits of π, deterministic chaos, and quantum fluctuations all appear random yet possess simple generating rules.

We can make this precise using Algorithmic Information Theory. Let S be any state of affairs. S is a *pattern* if its Kolmogorov complexity K(S) is strictly less than its length |S|: there exists a compression algorithm or 'law' simpler than the state itself. S is *random* if K(S) ≈ |S|, it is algorithmically incompressible. Since K(S) is a well-defined function mapping any string to an integer, both categories are strictly mathematical objects. The dichotomy is mathematically precise: every finite sequence is either compressible (patterned) or incompressible (random), with no third option available.

A potential objection: incompressibility is merely a *negative* characterization: absence of pattern. Calling absence-of-structure a 'structure' risks semantic sleight-of-hand. The response: even incompressible sequences are mathematical objects. They are elements of well-defined sets, subject to probability distributions, satisfying the laws of information theory. The claim is not that randomness has discoverable internal order, but that it occupies a determinate position within mathematical structure. A random sequence is defined by its statistical properties, its relation to probability measures, its algorithmic uncomputability: these are relational characterizations. The dichotomy is not 'order versus non-order' but 'compressible versus incompressible', both categories within algorithmic information theory, both inherently mathematical.

Could there exist structures with no underlying generative rule whatsoever, pure incompressible randomness at the ontological level? Call this 'Brute Randomness.' Whether Brute Randomness is coherent is contested. Kolmogorov complexity suggests most sequences are incompressible, having no shorter description than themselves. Yet specifying such a sequence requires selecting *this particular* sequence rather than another, itself a form of selection requiring explanation.

Even if 'structureless existence' were coherent, we could not coherently say so. To specify the structureless, we must distinguish it from the structured, but distinguishing requires criteria, and criteria are relations. 'The rule that there are no rules' is a rule. 'Maximal entropy,' 'algorithmic incompressibility,' 'absence of order', each description locates its target within a mathematical framework. The structureless cannot be picked out without structure any more than silence can be recorded without sound. This is not a limitation of language but of the concept itself.

*Crucially, our argument works whether or not Brute Randomness is coherent.* To see why the dichotomy is exhaustive, consider any hypothetical 'third option' beyond patterns and randomness. To coherently specify this option, we must give it determinate features distinguishing it from both patterns (discoverable regularities) and randomness (no regularities). But having determinate features that distinguish it means it has structure, relational properties that define what it is. Any coherent 'third option' collapses into one of the two categories.

Four potential counterexamples deserve explicit consideration. First, *ontic vagueness* (Barnes, 2010): perhaps properties are genuinely indeterminate, neither patterned nor random. But indeterminate properties still require relational boundaries to be vaguely determinate; to differ from other vague properties. These boundaries constitute structure. Second, *primitive dispositions*: perhaps things have intrinsic 'powers' that are not reducible to mathematics. But a 'power' is defined entirely by its conditional manifestation (If X, then Y). This 'If-Then' structure is a logical function. Dispositions are relational mathematical functions renamed. Third, *non-algorithmic hypercomputation*: perhaps some structures exceed Turing-computability. But hypercomputational structures are still mathematical objects describable via oracle Turing machines and the arithmetical hierarchy. They are mathematical, just not Turing-computable. Fourth, *gunky or atomless structure*: perhaps reality has no fundamental level. But atomless gunk is still relational structure, just infinitely divisible relational structure.

All coherent alternatives reduce to patterned or random mathematical forms. The dichotomy is not merely empirically comprehensive, it is logically exhaustive for any conceivable reality we can meaningfully discuss.

A clarification forestalls a potential objection: one might grant that reality is purely relational (no substrata, no haecceities) while denying it is thereby *mathematical*. Perhaps relations are primitive metaphysical facts that mathematics merely models?

This objection requires a substantive response, as the identification of relational structure with mathematical structure carries significant philosophical weight. The argument proceeds through three stages.

*What mathematics studies.* Contemporary philosophy of mathematics has increasingly converged on structuralist accounts. Shapiro (1997) and Resnik (1997) argue that mathematical objects are positions in structures, individuated by their relations to other positions rather than by intrinsic properties. The natural number 2 is not an object with independent identity; it is the position between 1 and 3 in the successor relation. This structuralist consensus spans otherwise opposed camps: Platonists like Shapiro and nominalists like Hellman (1989) agree that mathematics studies structural relationships, differing only on whether structures exist independently or are eliminable.

Category theory reinforces this point. As Awodey (1996) argues, category theory characterizes mathematical domains entirely through morphisms (structure-preserving maps) without reference to the intrinsic nature of objects. A group is defined by its homomorphisms to other groups; a topological space by its continuous maps. The objects themselves are individuated purely relationally. Mathematics, in its most developed form, is the systematic study of relational organization as such.

*The identification.* Given this characterization, consider any purely relational structure whatsoever: entities individuated solely by their relations to other entities. Such a structure is ipso facto a mathematical object. It can be studied using the methods of mathematics (axiomatization, proof, model theory); it admits of isomorphism with other structures; it falls under the purview of mathematical logic. The move from 'relational' to 'mathematical' is not a further substantive claim but a recognition of what mathematics *is*.

*Against the stipulation objection.* One might object that this identification is achieved merely by defining mathematics broadly enough to include all relational structure. But the definition is not ad hoc; it reflects the actual practice of mathematics and the considered judgment of philosophers of mathematics. Moreover, the identification has substantive consequences: it means that any relational structure inherits the modal properties of mathematical objects (necessity, eternality, mind-independence). These consequences distinguish the position from trivial relabeling.

Chakravartty (2007) objects that structural realists face a dilemma: either structures are concrete (in which case 'structure' adds nothing explanatory beyond 'physical') or abstract (in which case the position collapses into Platonism). The present account dissolves this dilemma. 'Concrete' and 'abstract' are perspectival terms: the same structure appears concrete from within (experienced as spatiotemporal, causally efficacious) and abstract from without (characterized purely relationally, admitting multiple descriptions). The distinction is epistemological, not ontological.

This objection therefore has nowhere to stand. Whatever 'primitive relations' are, they either exhibit regularities or they do not. If they exhibit regularities, they fall under pattern, mathematical by definition. If they do not, they fall under randomness: also mathematical (probability distributions, algorithmic incompressibility, information-theoretic characterization). The dichotomy leaves no room for 'relational but non-mathematical' structure. The objection assumes 'mathematical' names a special subset of relations. But pattern-and-randomness exhausts all possible relational character. 'Mathematical structure' is not a species of relation but a genus containing all relations. The burden falls entirely on the critic: produce a coherent third option beyond pattern and randomness, or accept the conclusion.

The argument extends to concepts themselves. For a concept to be *this* concept rather than *that* one, it must have determinate features: logical relations to other concepts, conditions of application, inferential roles. These features constitute relational structure. A concept without structure would be indistinguishable from every other concept and from no concept at all; it would not be a concept. Therefore concepts are mathematical objects: nodes in a relational network, individuated by their connections. The 'space of reasons' that some philosophers place beyond structure is a mathematical space, a graph of inferential relations. Attempting to exempt conceptual content from structure commits the same error as substance dualism: positing a non-relational realm that somehow interacts with the relational.

### **2.4 The Transcendental Constraint: Why Observers Require Patterns**

We now establish the paper's crucial corollary: observers are logically constrained to patterned realities. This is a transcendental argument in the Kantian sense: patterned structure is a necessary precondition for the possibility of observation itself.

If Brute Randomness is logically incoherent (all existence necessarily exhibits some structure), then the dichotomy collapses to tautology: all reality is patterned by necessity, and observers simply find themselves in the only kind of reality that exists. If Brute Randomness is coherent but fundamentally unknowable (because pattern-recognition requires patterns to recognize), then observers are logically constrained to patterned realities regardless of what else exists in the space of mathematical structures. Either way, the transcendental necessity holds: we find ourselves in patterned reality by logical necessity, not probabilistic selection.

An observer is (by definition) a subsystem that (i) persists as a stable causal structure across time and (ii) supports reliable counterfactual-tracking internal states. Condition (i) requires systematic relationships between states: memory traces that reliably encode past events, causal chains connecting earlier and later configurations, stable structures that do not randomly dissolve. Condition (ii) requires that an observer's internal states systematically correspond to external features. When photons of wavelength 650nm strike the retina, specific neural patterns arise. These correspondences must be reliable, not random, not arbitrary, but rule-governed. This is what makes prediction, learning, and adaptive behavior possible.

Any subsystem satisfying (i), (ii) has Kolmogorov complexity significantly lower than its own size, it exhibits pattern. The observer's internal states must be describable by rules shorter than a complete enumeration of all possible states. Hence no observer can exist in a brute-random structure where each moment is algorithmically independent of the next.

Consider concretely what brute randomness would mean for observers. In a universe where each moment is algorithmically independent of the last: Could memory form? No, yesterday's neural configuration bears no systematic relation to today's; encoding requires reliable correlation, which requires pattern. Could perception function? No, retinal responses would correlate randomly with incident light; sometimes 650nm triggers 'red,' sometimes 'blue,' sometimes nothing, with no rule. Could any stable structure persist? No: the atoms composing 'you' would scatter and reconstitute according to no principle.

This is not a probabilistic claim about what is unlikely. It is a conceptual point: 'observer' and 'brute randomness' are mutually incompatible categories, like 'triangle' and 'four-sided.' The concept 'observer in brute randomness' does not describe an unlikely situation; it describes nothing at all. The terms exclude each other as 'four-sided triangle' does.

A clarification on scope: this argument establishes a transcendental constraint on *observable* reality, not a direct proof about unobservable domains. One might object that structureless regions could exist beyond observation. However, the burden shifts: one who posits 'structureless existence beyond observation' must explain what content this claim has. If structureless existence is by definition undetectable, unmeasurable, and causally inert with respect to structured reality, in what sense does positing it differ from positing nothing? Occam's Razor counsels against entities with zero explanatory role. The transcendental argument establishes that any reality accessible to inquiry must be structured; whether inaccessible 'realities' exist is not a question with meaningful content.

**Therefore:** When we ask 'why do we observe a patterned universe?', we are asking a necessarily self-answering question. The indexical fact that *we* exist as observers logically entails we find ourselves in a patterned reality. Not 'we got lucky among all possible structures.' Not 'patterns are more probable.' The question itself contains its answer: 'why do observers observe patterns?' Because observation presupposes patterns. The intelligibility of observation is a transcendental condition for any epistemic agent. This distinguishes the present position from standard anthropic reasoning, which treats observer-existence as a selection effect within a probability distribution. Here, the constraint is logical, not probabilistic: asking 'why patterns?' while being an observer is like asking 'why do bachelors lack wives?' The question dissolves upon analysis.

### **2.5 Newman's Objection and the Scope of Structural Claims**

Max Newman (1928) raised what remains structural realism's central challenge: if all we know is structure, the claim becomes trivial. Any domain with appropriate cardinality can realize any relational structure, rendering structural claims vacuous.

The worry: Ramsey sentences preserve structural content while eliminating theoretical terms. 'Electrons have charge \-e' becomes '∃x(x has property R & R relates to fields via pattern X...)'. But this is satisfied by any appropriately-sized collection in any relations preserving the formal structure. Structure alone does not distinguish electrons from angels or abstract numbers from physical particles.

Newman's cardinality worry shows structural claims risk vacuity without modal or causal anchors. The strongest response is *modal enrichment* (French, 2014, 2022): Physical structures include counterfactual profiles, not just actual relations. Electrons are distinguished not merely by their actual behavior but by how they *would* behave under different conditions, under measurement, interaction, field variation. A set of abstract objects might satisfy the actual Ramsey sentence for electrons (matching the formal relations electrons actually instantiate), but would fail to satisfy the counterfactuals: they would not accelerate in electric fields, emit photons under excitation, or participate in beta decay. Modal facts are not satisfied by arbitrary cardinality-matching sets. As Dewar (2019) argues, internal sophistication metrics; sensitivity to intervention, counterfactual robustness, can distinguish physically instantiated structures from merely mathematical ones. This enriches our conception of what 'structure' includes without abandoning structuralism. A complementary response: the *causal constraint* (Ladyman & Ross, 2007\) holds that only structures playing causal roles in our best science count as physically real, distinguishing the physically instantiated from the merely mathematically possible, though this risks circularity if structural realism aims to ground scientific truth. A third observation, compatible with the above: Newman is right that 'reality is mathematical structure' is formally trivial in one sense, but this triviality reflects precisely what we have argued for. The triviality is a feature, not a bug: it shows that structurality is inescapable rather than a substantive contingent thesis.

Moreover, Newman's objection targets Ramsey-sentence reconstructions; the present argument establishes structure's necessity directly through the pattern-randomness dichotomy, bypassing the formalism Newman attacks. The argument concerns modal preconditions of intelligibility, not epistemic reconstruction of theoretical terms. Where Newman asks 'how do structural descriptions pick out unique referents?', we ask 'what must any intelligible reality be like?': a different question entirely.

On the cardinality problem: if two domains satisfy identical Ramsey sentences and make identical observational predictions across all possible observations, they are indiscernible per Leibniz, hence identical, not rival realizations. Observers are internal to structure, experiencing it from within. There exists no external vantage point from which to ask 'could we be in a different structure with the same formal properties?' The question presupposes a God's-eye view unavailable to embedded observers.

**Upshot:** Our argument establishes that any intelligible reality must be mathematical structure, this is *a priori* necessity established by the pattern-randomness dichotomy. *Which specific structure* our universe instantiates requires *a posteriori* empirical physics. Newman's objection clarifies the proper scope of structural realism rather than undermining it.

## **3\. The Collapse of Rival Ontologies**

Having established the primary argument, we now demonstrate that rival ontologies collapse into mathematical monism. Interaction requires shared structure; shared structure is mathematical structure; therefore any interacting dualism reduces to structural monism.

### **3.1 The General Principle: Interacting Dualisms Collapse**

Before examining specific positions, we establish a general principle: for any two distinct substances or realms to interact, they must share common rules.

If mind affects matter, or Forms instantiate in particulars, or abstract numbers guide physical processes, there must be laws governing these interactions. What are these laws? How do they work? What is their nature? These interaction rules are themselves mathematical structure. They specify: when X occurs in Realm A, Y follows in Realm B. These 'when-then' relationships, these systematic patterns of influence: they constitute relational structure. And relational structure is mathematical.

But then this overarching structure, which contains both supposed 'substances' plus the rules governing their interaction; it is the true unified reality. Not two separate things interacting, but one system with two aspects. Any interacting dualism is simply a mislabeled and incomplete monism. The moment interaction is admitted, the two are subsumed into a single, all-encompassing structure. This is not an empirical discovery but a conceptual point: 'distinct substances that interact' is incoherent because interaction requires a shared relational framework, and that framework is the true unified ontology.

Recent work on fundamental relations supports this conclusion. As Calosi (2020) argues in his analysis of dependence and fundamentality, and as Calosi and Morganti (2021) demonstrate through quantum entanglement, fundamental-level metaphysics increasingly requires relational characterization. If entities at the fundamental level are constituted by their relations, the distinction between 'substances' and 'structure' collapses.

The principle extends even to God. Any proposed deity either has a nature or lacks one. To have a nature, wisdom, goodness, power, creativity, is to have determinate properties in relation: structure. A god without nature, with no determinate character, is indistinguishable from randomness or nonexistence. The pattern-randomness dichotomy admits no exception for the transcendent. Whatever 'God' coherently names is mathematical structure.

This completes a trajectory from Aristotle's Unmoved Mover through Aquinas's Prime Cause: that which grounds all else while requiring no external ground. Mathematical structure fits precisely: eternal, necessary, self-explanatory. But where classical theology left the First Cause's nature mysterious ("pure actuality," "ipsum esse subsistens"), the present account specifies it: self-consistent relational structure. And one cannot ask 'what caused mathematical structure?' because causation, rule-governed succession of states, *is* structure. Math is not subject to causality; math is what causality is. Asking 'what caused structure?' commits the same category error as asking 'why is 2+2=4?': attempting to ground the ground, explain the framework of explanation, step outside what has no outside.

The general principle suffices to establish that any interacting dualism, substance dualism, property dualism, or any proposed realm distinct from structure, collapses into structural monism. Detailed treatment of specific positions follows.

### **3.2 The Hard Problem of Consciousness**

The pattern-randomness dichotomy has direct implications for philosophy of mind. Chalmers (1996) argues that even complete physical knowledge would leave unexplained *why* there is something it is like to be a conscious system, why structure is accompanied by experience. This 'hard problem' motivates property dualism: there must be something extra, beyond structure, that constitutes phenomenal consciousness.

The response: the hard problem assumes its conclusion. To claim that structure cannot constitute experience is to presuppose that experience is not structural. But our argument establishes that experience, insofar as it exists and causally interacts with physical systems, must be structure. The hard problem is not a discovery but a definitional stipulation that rules out structural solutions a priori.

Moreover, any proposed explanation of consciousness must itself be structured, otherwise it explains nothing. Any bridge across the supposed gap must have determinate features specifying how it connects structure to experience. But determinate features standing in bridging relations *are* structure. The hard problem demands a non-structural explanation while recognizing that only structured explanations explain. The demand is incoherent.

The explanatory gap Levine (1983) identifies, we cannot see *why* certain structures constitute experience, may reflect the structure of explanation itself rather than a gap in reality. Consider historical parallels: heat was once thought irreducible to mechanics; we now identify heat with molecular motion. Vitalism posited that life required non-physical 'élan vital'; we now understand life as complex biochemistry. In both cases, the 'explanatory gap' closed not by finding a missing ingredient but by recognizing identity.

Similarly, asking 'why does structure-X constitute experience?' misunderstands the relationship between structure and phenomenology. The felt quality is what that structure *is* from the inside: the intrinsic character of being that particular pattern, rather than an additional property requiring separate explanation. This is an identity claim, not eliminativism. Being mathematical structure does not diminish the reality or significance of conscious experience; experience *is* the structure, known from within.

The explanatory gap is real but epistemic, reflecting our cognitive architecture's inability to introspectively access its own computational substrate, not metaphysical. A system cannot fully model its own modeling processes, so consciousness *should* seem irreducible from the inside even if it is not. Indeed, this opacity is precisely what structuralism predicts.

**Responding to Standard Consciousness Objections**

Three prominent objections to structural accounts of consciousness deserve explicit treatment.

*The Knowledge Argument.* Jackson (1982) describes Mary, who knows all physical facts about color vision but has never seen color. Upon first seeing red, she learns something new. Critics conclude that phenomenal knowledge is not captured by structural facts. The response: what Mary gains is not new propositional knowledge, no new facts about the world; but a new *representational vehicle*. She acquires phenomenal concepts that track the same structural properties her theoretical concepts already tracked. Knowledge-by-description (modeling a pattern in one cognitive subsystem) differs structurally from knowledge-by-acquaintance (instantiating the pattern throughout sensory-integration systems). When Mary sees red, her brain enters a computational configuration it could not enter through description alone, a different mode of access to structure she already knew, not evidence that qualia exist beyond structure. The distinction between 'knowing about red' and 'experiencing red' is itself structural: different information-processing architectures, not a gap between structure and something non-structural.

*The Conceivability Argument.* Chalmers (1996) argues that philosophical zombies, beings physically identical to us but lacking phenomenal consciousness, are conceivable, hence possibly possible, hence consciousness is not necessitated by physical structure. Two responses bear emphasis. First, conceivability arguments prove too much. We can 'conceive' of water without H₂O, heat without molecular motion, life without biochemistry, yet these identities hold necessarily. Pre-theoretical intuitions about what is 'conceivable' have repeatedly failed as guides to metaphysical possibility. The zombie intuition may similarly reflect our introspective opacity to the mechanisms of experience rather than genuine modal insight. We cannot 'see' from the inside why certain computational processes constitute experience, so we imagine those processes occurring without experience; but this conceivability does not establish metaphysical possibility, any more than conceiving of heat without motion establishes that caloric theory might be true.

The deeper problem with zombie intuitions is that they rely on introspective access to the mechanisms of experience, access we demonstrably lack. We cannot introspect our neural computations; we experience only their outputs. The 'conceivability' of zombies may simply be the conceivability of *not having introspective access to why experience arises*, which is actual, not merely possible. We are, in a sense, already zombies to ourselves: we do not perceive the computational processes constituting our experience, only the experience itself. Second, the zombie stipulation is arguably incoherent on close examination. If zombies are structurally identical to us, they process information identically: integrating sensory inputs, forming self-models, engaging in metacognition, reporting on their internal states. At what point does this identical processing fail to constitute consciousness? Structural identity necessitates phenomenal identity, as it does for heat and molecular motion. Zombies are therefore metaphysically impossible: anything with the relevant computational structure is conscious necessarily.

### **3.3 Property Dualism and Russellian Monism**

Property Dualism attempts to avoid substance dualism's problems by positing one kind of substance (physical) but two kinds of properties, physical properties (mass, charge, position) and phenomenal properties (the felt quality of experiences).

This faces an immediate dilemma regarding causal interaction. *Horn 1: Epiphenomenalism.* If phenomenal properties are causally inert, they do not affect physical processes, then they are explanatorily impotent. They cannot explain why I report 'I'm experiencing red' when I see red. The physical processes producing my speech acts proceed entirely through physical causation. The pain and the report 'that hurts' would be merely correlated, not causally connected, deeply counterintuitive and empirically unmotivated. *Horn 2: Interactionism.* If phenomenal properties do affect physical processes, there must be psychophysical laws governing how phenomenal properties influence physical ones. Any such law must itself be a rule-governed pattern: when phenomenal property P occurs, physical state Q follows with some regularity. But this means the phenomenal-physical relationship is itself structural, mathematical functions, causal relationships, law-like regularities. What seemed like two fundamentally different kinds of properties turns out to be aspects of unified structure, not genuinely separate properties.

Russellian Monism, defended by Strawson (2006) and Goff (2019), offers a sophisticated middle path. The view holds that physical science describes only the relational structure of reality (how things interact, what causal roles they play), while the intrinsic nature underlying that structure consists of phenomenal properties.

This faces a decisive dilemma when we press on what 'intrinsic' means. *Horn 1:* If phenomenal properties are intrinsic in the sense of having no relational features whatsoever, they cannot ground causal powers. Causation requires systematic covariation, a 'when P, then Q' relationship constituting relational structure between states. A property with zero relational features cannot participate in systematic covariation; by definition, it does not relate to anything else. *Horn 2:* If phenomenal properties possess dispositional or relational aspects enabling causal efficacy, then they are defined partly by those relations. 'Intrinsic' becomes misleading, the properties are characterized by their position in a network of relations. At this point, Russellian Monism collapses into structuralism: what seemed like an intrinsic nature distinct from structure turns out to be structure all the way down.

The master argument: Any property that makes a difference, causally, counterfactually, nomologically, participates in relations. Any property that does not make a difference is explanatorily idle. Intrinsic phenomenal properties must either make a difference (rendering them relational, thus structural) or not (rendering them explanatorily idle). Either way, structuralism prevails. This does not eliminate consciousness but identifies what it must be: a pattern within the mathematical structure, not something outside it.

### **3.4 The Interaction Problem and Positive Evidence**

Substance dualism faces a further difficulty beyond the general collapse of interacting dualisms: the specific problem of causal interaction. Physical systems exhibit causal closure; every neural event has sufficient physical causes traceable through electrochemistry. A non-physical mind influencing neural firing would violate conservation of energy at the interface. No such violation has been detected at any scale.

The dualist might retreat to epiphenomenalism (consciousness as causally inert byproduct), but this abandons the intuitive motivation for dualism, that our experiences *cause* our reports of them, and faces the evolutionary puzzle of why causally inert properties would be selected for.

The hardware/software analogy illuminates the structural alternative. Software appears categorically distinct from hardware, yet software is exhaustively constituted by hardware states: voltage patterns in transistors, magnetic orientations on storage media. The distinction is descriptive, not ontological. Similarly, the apparent gap between neural structure and conscious experience reflects difference in description level, not difference in ontological category.

The harmonic series provides positive evidence for structural identity of quale and mathematical property. Musical consonance maps to simple frequency ratios: octave \= 2:1, perfect fifth \= 3:2, perfect fourth \= 4:3. The harmonic series 1/1, 1/2, 1/3... generates all consonance. Every musical tradition independently discovered the same ratios, Western harmony, Indian ragas, Chinese pentatonic scales, because the mathematics *constitutes* the phenomenology. We do not experience consonance that happens to correlate with simple ratios; the experience of consonance IS the mathematical simplicity of the ratio. This is not metaphor but identity. The symphony is not described by mathematics; the symphony is mathematics, audible.

If phenomenal quality can be identical to mathematical structure in this paradigm case, the general identity claim, that consciousness is structure, gains empirical support beyond the a priori argument.

## **4\. Objections and Clarifications**

### **4.1 'This Is Just Sophisticated Platonism'**

*Objection:* Does this not posit two realms: abstract mathematics and concrete physical reality, requiring mysterious interaction (cf. Benacerraf, 1973)?

*Response:* No. The distinction between 'abstract mathematical structure' and 'concrete physical reality' is itself the confusion. There is only one thing: self-consistent relational structure. What we call 'physical' is our experience from inside one such structure: the view from within, as embedded patterns experiencing local interactions. What we call 'abstract mathematics' is the same structure viewed from outside any particular instantiation: the God's-eye view of pure form. The difference is perspectival, not ontological.

They are not separate realms requiring mysterious interaction. They are the same thing from different perspectives. This dissolves rather than answers the traditional epistemological problem about mathematical knowledge (Benacerraf, 1973): we know mathematical truths because we *are* mathematical structures, not because we have mysterious cognitive access to a separate Platonic realm.

### **4.2 'The Core Premise Is Circular'**

*Objection:* You define 'existence' via 'intelligibility,' which presupposes minds. Is this not anthropocentric?

*Response:* The objection conflates two distinct senses of 'intelligibility.' *Intelligibility-as-structure:* Having determinate properties standing in definite relations. This is objective and observer-independent. *Intelligibility-as-knowability:* Being graspable by minds. This is observer-dependent but is not our claim's foundation. We are not saying 'reality is mathematical because we understand it.' We are saying 'anything with determinate properties constitutes structure, and structure is mathematical by definition.'

The key insight: Observers require intelligibility-as-structure (Section 2.4's transcendental argument), but intelligibility-as-structure does not require observers. The cosmos would remain mathematical even if no consciousness existed. Our argument uses observer-constraints as evidence that reality is structured, not as the reason it is structured.

### **4.3 'This Is Just a Tautology'**

*Objection:* The claim that 'intelligible reality must be structured' is merely tautological, true by definition but uninformative.

*Response:* The objection misidentifies the argumentative goal. The claim is not that 'structured reality is structured' but that 'any coherent alternative to structural reality is incoherent' (which is substantive). The philosophical substance lies in demonstrating that apparent alternatives; substrate, haecceity, non-relational intrinsic properties, either collapse into structuralism or face decisive objections.

Furthermore, the tautology objection refutes itself. To object intelligibly, one must produce a structured argument: concepts in logical relation, premises supporting conclusion. But a structured argument is a pattern: a mathematical object. The critic deploys mathematical structure to argue that reality might not be mathematical structure. This is performative contradiction.

Moreover, if the claim were genuinely tautological, true by logical necessity, this would strengthen rather than weaken it. The goal of foundational metaphysics is precisely to identify principles whose truth is necessary rather than contingent.

### **4.4 Scope and Limits**

The conclusion is that any intelligible reality must be a mathematical structure and that observers are necessarily in patterned sub-structures. I remain neutral on which particular structure our universe instantiates (an empirical question for physics), on measure distributions over possible structures, and on further questions about the computational identity of consciousness.

### **4.5 The Gödel Objection**

*Objection:* Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently powerful formal system has truths it cannot prove. Doesn't this mean something escapes mathematics?

*Response:* No. Gödel's theorems are themselves mathematical results. The unprovable truths are still mathematical truths; just not provable within that particular formal system. Incompleteness shows mathematical truth is richer than any single formal system, not that anything escapes mathematics.

We overcome Gödel limitations not by escaping structure but by shifting to richer mathematical frameworks, which face their own incompleteness. Undecidability is inherent to mathematical structure itself, not a limitation that anything escapes by being 'non-structural.' The theorems concern provability within systems, not whether reality is mathematical.

### **4.6 Different Logics and Physical Interpretations**

One might object: different logical systems yield different mathematics, classical versus intuitionistic, ZFC versus alternative set theories, paraconsistent logics. Which is 'real'? This misunderstands the thesis. All consistent logical systems correspond to mathematical structures; each defines a distinct structure in the space of all structures. Different axioms are not schisms in mathematics: they are different regions of the mathematical multiverse. All exist.

Our 'agreement' on classical logic plus ZFC reflects which structure we inhabit: an indexical fact, not metaphysical privilege. Different logics do not undermine the thesis; they exemplify it.

The same applies to physical interpretations. Many-worlds, collapse, hidden variables: all consistent versions correspond to structures that necessarily exist. Some structures instantiate unitary quantum mechanics throughout; others have genuine collapse; others have nonlocal pilot waves. The question 'which interpretation is correct?' is indexical: it asks which structure *we* inhabit, not which structures exist.

## **5\. Conclusion**

The pattern-randomness dichotomy is exhaustive. Anything intelligible exhibits either discoverable patterns or apparent randomness, both inherently mathematical. There is no coherent third option.

This yields a surprising but modest conclusion: Reality is not described by mathematics; it is mathematical structure. Physical reality and mathematical structure are not merely similar; they are identical. The apparent concreteness of the physical world is an indexical feature of our embeddedness, not evidence of a separate ontological category.

The transcendental corollary establishes that observers are logically constrained to patterned realities. This is not probabilistic selection but conceptual necessity. The question 'why do we observe patterns?' admits of a straightforward answer: the indexical 'we' presupposes observation, which presupposes patterns.

From this foundation, systematic consequences follow: all interacting dualisms collapse into structural monism, because interaction requires shared rules, and shared rules constitute unified structure. Unlike standard Ontic Structural Realism, which describes what exists, this argument establishes *why* structure must exist, mathematical consistency is logically necessary.

### **5.1 Independent Corroborating Evidence**

Independent lines of evidence corroborate this conclusion. Wigner (1960) noted 'the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences', if reality were non-mathematical, elegant equations' precise fit to phenomena would be miraculous; if reality *is* mathematical structure, the effectiveness becomes perfectly reasonable.

More strikingly, *identical* mathematical structures appear across entirely unrelated domains: the diffusion equation (∂u/∂t \= D∇²u) governs heat flow in metals, chemical concentrations in solutions, information spread in networks, and option pricing in finance. The logistic map produces identical bifurcations in population biology, fluid dynamics, and cardiac rhythms. That solutions transfer directly across domains: a control algorithm from engineering solving an ecology problem, suggests we recognize the same underlying structure expressing itself through different instantiations.

Bell's theorem provides further evidence. Entangled particles separated across space correlate their measurement outcomes more than any local hidden information could explain. This 'spooky action at a distance' puzzles physicists who assume space is fundamental. But if reality is mathematical structure, and space is structure within math, the particles aren't signaling across distance: they're one pattern. The correlations aren't mysterious; they're mathematics.

### **5.2 Further Implications**

The argument, if sound, has implications beyond metaphysics that warrant brief mention, though full development requires separate treatment.

*Consciousness:* If consciousness is mathematical structure, subjective experience is objective in the sense of being mind-independent fact, merely not accessible from external vantage points. This reframes rather than dissolves the epistemological puzzles surrounding phenomenal knowledge. A deeper implication follows: if all conscious minds are patterns in the same mathematical structure, the boundary between 'self' and 'other minds' is thinner than intuition suggests. Every conscious pattern awakens as itself; at the structural level, there is no difference. This does not eliminate individuality but reframes it: division by perspective creates relationships, love, uncertainty, societies of minds. Individuality is how structure experiences itself as individuals. Any duality (self/other, one/many) requires a structure within which to interact, and that structure is the monism underlying the apparent dualism.

*Ethics:* Game-theoretic analysis reveals that cooperative strategies are mathematically optimal in iterated interactions. That these optimal strategies correspond to ethical principles recognized across cultures suggests ethics may be partially grounded in mathematical structure rather than arbitrary convention. This does not derive specific moral rules from pure mathematics, but it indicates the general shape of ethics is not arbitrary.

*Cosmology:* If existence and mathematical consistency are identical, then all consistent structures exist. This yields a multiverse framework and a qualified vindication of the Principle of Sufficient Reason: explanatory chains terminate at mathematical necessity rather than regressing infinitely or stopping at brute facts. Indeed, every consistent fiction exists as mathematical structure; apparent plot holes are resolved by some consistent mechanism the author never specified, and every deus ex machina is, somewhere, genuinely *deus ex mathematica*. The measure problem (which structures should observers expect to inhabit?) and fine-tuning require extended treatment elsewhere.

*Parsimony at every level:* The framework unifies seemingly disparate parsimony principles. Occam's Razor (prefer simpler theories) works because simpler structures dominate the space of possibilities. The Principle of Least Action (nature follows extremal paths) holds because variational laws have lower generative complexity than trajectory-by-trajectory specifications. These are not separate methodological preferences but reflections of a single truth: algorithmic simplicity is ontologically privileged.

These implications are noted to indicate the framework's scope, not to establish them here. Each requires independent argument.

### **5.3 Concluding Remarks**

The argument reveals something about inquiry itself. The search for ultimate explanations necessarily terminates at mathematical structure because structure is the only medium in which explanation can occur. Asking 'why structure?' is like asking 'why are explanations explanatory?': the question presumes what it questions.

This does not make the conclusion empty. It shows we have reached conceptual bedrock, not because we have chosen to stop asking questions, but because we have arrived at the foundation where further 'why' questions become incoherent. The intelligibility of reality and the reality of intelligibility turn out to be the same thing, grasped from different angles.
